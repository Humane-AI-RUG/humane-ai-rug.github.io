The repository itself is a normal [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. It can be easily viewed and edited through the Obsidian application. As all files are text-based Markdown files, they can also be edited and viewed directly without using the Obsidian application.
At the moment, sharing and collaboration of the vault is done through [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Obsidian has many cool features, and supports e.g., multimedia, Mermaid diagrams, tables, and Dataview. We can use it to manage tasks, calendars, and to generate charts as well!

This vault is compiled with [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/) and deployed through [GitHub Pages](github.com). Note that all information in this repository is public. All personal information has been gathered from public sources.
