The [[Nederlandse AI Coalitie]] has a repository containing AI-related programmes in the Netherlands in general at https://educatie.nlaic.com/. [It has a web interface as well](https://educatie.nlaic.com/opleidingen/ai-opleidingen-database/).

[A report on the state of AI education in the Netherlands was published](https://educatie.nlaic.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/NLA_Eindrapportage_v2.3.pdf). The [[University of Groningen]] was represented by [[prof. dr. Niels Taatgen]].

It does not appear that there is a formal (and accredited) program specifically for Humane AI in the Netherlands. However, the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] offers a Technology, Law & Ethics programme, and the [[University of Amsterdam]] offers a degree in Humans, Society, and Technology.

That said, most AI-related programmes have one or more courses related to ethics and society.
