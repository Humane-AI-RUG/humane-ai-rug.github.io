[The Algorithm Register](https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/)

_The government wants the government to use algorithms responsibly. People must be able to trust that algorithms comply with the values and norms of society. And there must be an explanation of how algorithms work. When the government is open about algorithms and their application, citizens, organizations and media can monitor it critically and check whether it is following the law and the rules._
