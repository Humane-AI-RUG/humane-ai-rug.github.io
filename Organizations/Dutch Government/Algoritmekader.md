The Dutch legal framework for algorithms. [Homepage](https://minbzk.github.io/Algoritmekader/)

_Government organisations need to understand the requirements for responsible use of algorithms and AI.
Various tools have been developed to better apply laws and regulations.
The algorithm framework prioritises and streamlines these tools, providing practical guidance through all stages of an algorithmâ€™s lifecycle.
Best practices, use cases, and feedback from end users and regulators contribute to a strong and widely accepted implementation framework for all government bodies.
The algorithm framework for the public sector uses an open source approach._
