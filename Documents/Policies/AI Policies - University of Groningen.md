- [Full UG policy on AI in teaching](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/organization/quality-assurance/education/eng-rug-beleid-ai-in-onderwijs-2023-def.pdf)

## Vision
The full UG policy outlines the following overall vision:

_The UG aims to train its students within the context of their degree programmes to become competent and responsible users of AI tools, in accordance with academic ways of working, attitudes, and core principles. To this end, the UG uses a set of ten basic rules and introduces action lines to provide information to students and lecturers and support them in learning to use AI
tools. This policy also defines responsibilities. Degree programmes will have to review their teaching, assessment, and learning outcomes and decide to what extent they are affected by AI tools. There is no one-size-fits-all approach for this, as the impact varies per degree programme and per discipline. Faculties can therefore supplement the UG policy with their own rules and activities to suit their own context. This will enable us to explore the promising potential of AI tools together within joint frameworks._
